                                TecHive is a company that was born out of the need for quality. Me and my colleagues have been victims of badly built software numerous times, whether its that school website that is always crashing or its that online shop that always gets your order wrong or that internet provider that's always providing poor internet <span role="img" aria-label="emoji">üôÅ</span>.<br/>
                                So we sat down and decided to form a company that would deal in quality software only <span role="img" aria-label="emoji">üòÉ</span>.
                                {/* We were tired of always calling the help center to get issues fixed. We decided quality first was the way to go, creating a product and getting it right the first time(Philip Crosby, Zero Defects Program) <span role="img" aria-label="emoji">üòé</span>. Since if you create a quality product the first time, then you'll have fewer issues later on.<br/>  */}
                               {/*Joining the technology industry, we quickly realized that TRUST is very important. Clients need to know that you can do the task they're asking for. So we took that need for trust and we added it to our values. Now we not only build quality software but also make sure we build a bond of trust between us and the client. This method has worked for us so far and we intend to build it into our brand. */}
